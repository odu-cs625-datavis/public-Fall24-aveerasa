# Chapter 12 (Facet into Multiple Views) 

## Strategies for Managing Complexity in Visualizations
1. derive new data to include in a view (Ch 3)
1. changing a single view over time (Ch 11)
1. *faceting data (juxtapose or superimpose) into multiple views (Ch 12)*
1. reducing the amount of data to show in a view (Ch 13)
1. embedding focus and context information together in one view (Ch 14)

## Design Choices for Faceting into Multiple Views

### Juxtapose Views Side-by-Side
* which visual encoding channels are shared?
* is highlighting linked between the views?
* how much of the data is shared?
* is navigation synchronized?

### Partition into Side-by-Side Views
* how many regions?
* how to divide the data into regions?
* what is the order in which attributes are used to split the data?

### Superimpose Layers
* how are elements partitioned between layers?
* how many layers to use?
* how to distinguish layers from each other?
* are the layers statically or dynamically constructed?
